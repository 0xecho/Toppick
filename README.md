# Toppick
## Description
**tl;dr** This is a website that keeps track of your top picks in a particular category like movies, music, or video games.

If you are like me, you have a lot of things to do. One of them is to have conversations with other people.
A common theme that keeps popping up is "What is your favorite \[Movie or Music or Video game\]?" or more generatlly "What are your top picks for \[Movie or Music or Video game\]?"
If you've met me before, and you've asked me for a list of my top picks, you'll see that they tend to change quite frequently. That's because I'm a a dummy who forgets my top picks every now and then, especially when I've been away from the particular \[Movie or Music or Video game\] I'm interested in. Basically, I'm a dummy who doesn't remember my top picks. So I'm making this small website so I can properly rank my top picks and keep track of them. 

## Features
Basic features:
* **Rank Picks**: This is where you can compare 2 random picks from the same category, choose the one you like the most, and rank it as your top pick.
* **Add new picks**: You can add new picks to the website. These may be movies, music, or video games.
* **Modify a pick**: You can modify a pick that you've already added. Maybe you made a mistake, or maybe season 8 came out and it ruined the whole experience for you (damn you Game of Thrones).
* **View your top picks**: You can view your top picks. You can see the top picks for movies, music, or video games. You can sort them, filter them, search them, export them, import them ... you name it.
And that's it!
